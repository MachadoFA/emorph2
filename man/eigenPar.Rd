\title{A multivariate test of parallel evolution between multiple lineages}
\usage{
eigenPar(
  X1,
  X2 = NULL,
  null = c("random", "drift"),
  sims = 999,
  alpha = c(0.025, 0.975),

}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{Matrix kxn for k number of traits and n lineages. A matrix of
multivariate averages of lineages before selection/
experimental manipulation OR a multivariate matrix of differences between
before and after selection.}

\item{X2}{NULL or a kxn matrix of multivariate averages of lineages before
selection. If a value is provided, it has to be of the same dimentions as \code{X1}}

\item{null}{Character. Type of null hypothesis to be tested. If \code{null=
"random"}, tests if empirical vectors differs from totally random directions.
If null="drift", function tests if vectors differsn from what is expected
under drift. A \code{G} matrix has to be provided.}

\item{G}{Default to NULL. A kxk matrix of genetic covariances. Only used if
\code{null="drift"}.}

\details{
The user can provide the function with either the lineages means before
and after selection/experimental manipulation (by using both \code{X1} and \code{X2}
respectively), or the vectors of differences between lineages.

The function uses the within-lineage vectors of differences to calculates the
 matrix C of pairwise vector correlations

\deqn{C=XX^t}

with X being the matrix of within-lineage normalized vectors of divergence. The eigenvalues of C are a measure of how much divergence occured along the same directions.

To evaluate if observed patterns cannot be explained by chance alone,  the function employs a simulation procedure to generate a distribution of eigenvalues. The "random" eigenvalues are confronted agaist the observed ones to provide a p-value for each individual dimension. The function allows for the test of two null hypotheses. If \code{null="random"}, the null distribution is built by re-estimating C from completly random vectors, as suggested by De Lisle & Bolnick (2020). If \code{null="drift"}, vectors are simulated using the multivariate breeder's equation (Lande, 1979) as follows

\deqn{\Delta x= G (t/Nef)}

where \code{G} is the among traits genetic variance-covariance matrix, \code{t} is time and \code{Nef} is the effective population size. Because we are only interested in directions, both \code{t} and \code{Nef} can be ignored, but \code{G} has to be provided by the user.
